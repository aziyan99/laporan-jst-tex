	abstract = {Each student has been given a guide book as the guidelines to their final assignment. But in fact, the students still face the difficulties in following the guidelines and finishing their final assignment. It caused their final assignment need to be evaluate based on the format. In increasing the assessment process on how effective and proper of the assignment, usually could be found through the final conclusion of their final assignment. It may caused some mistaken assessment in objectivity. This research will be implement the neural network by using BackPropagation Algorithm in order to know how effective it is, based on the final assignment of the college students through Matlab 6.1 Software. The assessment will use some methods in comparing of the neural network, to find the final conclusion about the reasonable of the research.},
